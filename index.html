    Welcome!  I'm Caracalla, a pseudonym I chose from the Roman emperor entirely because I liked his mean look.  This is my collection of stuff, mostly about programming, but maybe also art.

    <h2>Blog</h2>

        <strong>How I Got into Tech</strong> (planned) - My path was a little unconventional, and I've met a lot of people embarking on the same journey, so I'd like to detail how I got here, if only so I can keep my story straight!
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Everything I Know About System Design</strong> (planned) - As I learn more about designing high traffic, low level systems, I'd like to record my thoughts, in the hopes of developing a comprehensive understanding of how to reliably build these things

        Hey all you Javascript haters out there, you'll be happy to know this blog will still render without JS enabled!  I do use canvas for some things, like interactive demos using canvas, but hopefully I'll be able to provide alternative means of showing off.

      Hi, I'm James.  I'm a software artist (somewhat analogous to a Subway "sandwich artist") currently working on real time rendering, and learning how to draw.

        Hey all you Javascript haters out there, you'll be happy to know this blog will still render without JS enabled!  I do use canvas for some things, like interactive demos, but hopefully I'll be able to provide alternative means of showing off.

    <h2>Casual Updates</h2>

    <ul class="casual-updates">
      <li>
        <strong>2021-09-07</strong>: Found the <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples">Vulkan-Samples</a> repository, which seems to contain the solution(s) to my aforementioned problem(s).  </a>Started <a href="https://github.com/caracalla/cmaketest">learning CMake</a> as well, since this and other repositories make heavy use of it.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>2021-08-30</strong>: Turns out learning Vulkan is hard; there's so many ways to do any particular thing.  Currently struggling with how to propagate model transformation matrices to vertex shaders for each model.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>2021-08-24</strong>: I've made pretty good progress on the Vulkan tutorial, as captured in <strong>phalanx</strong>.  I'm hoping to dive into <a href="https://github.com/Novum/vkQuake">vkQuake</a> and <a href="https://github.com/whatever">vkDOOM3</a> to better understand how Vulkan is actually used to do real time rendering in 3D game engines, since the tutorial really only renders static content, and doesn't deal with continually updated vertices and camera position.  My <strong>buffdog</strong> project handles this, but it's also a very hacky software renderer, and I'm planning to supplement it with a Vulkan renderer once my work with phalanx has run its course.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>2021-08-23</strong>: I'm hoping to post casual updates here on a regular basis from now on.  Right now, I don't really have an audience to talk about my work with, Twitter feels too restrictive, and writing a full blog post is too high of a bar.

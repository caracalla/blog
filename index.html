    <h2>Casual Updates</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>2021-08-24</strong>: I've made pretty good progress on the Vulkan tutorial, as captured in <strong>phalanx</strong>".  I'm hoping to dive into <a href="https://github.com/Novum/vkQuake">vkQuake</a> and <a href="https://github.com/whatever">vkDOOM3</a> to better understand how Vulkan is actually used to do real time rendering in 3D game engines, since the tutorial really only renders static content, and doesn't deal with continually updated vertices and camera position.  My <strong>buffdog</strong> project handles this, but it's also a very hacky software renderer, and I'm planning to supplement it with a Vulkan renderer once my work with phalanx has run its course.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>2021-08-23</strong>: I'm hoping to post casual updates here on a regular basis from now on.  Right now, I don't really have an audience to talk about my work with, Twitter feels too restrictive, and writing a full blog post for something is a bar I may never surmount.  Obviously, no one is reading these yet, but maybe someday someone will come across this, and if nothing else, it's something I can come back to later.

    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>

    <p>
      Hi, I'm James.  I'm a software artist (somewhat analogous to a Subway "sandwich artist") currently working on real time rendering, and learning how to draw.  I've worked at several failed startups and evil corporations.  My dream is to either become a house husband and spend my time tinkering on little side projects, or become a fabulously wealthy C-level executive and buy several megayachts.  I haven't quite decided yet.

      Hi, I'm James.  I'm a software artist (somewhat analogous to a Subway "sandwich artist") currently working on real time rendering, and learning how to draw.

        Hey all you Javascript haters out there, you'll be happy to know all content on this blog will still render without JS enabled!  I do use canvas for some things, like interactive demos, but hopefully I'll be able to provide alternative means of showing off.

        <strong>2022-08-10</strong>: I've finally begun to accept the fact that my work-and-pandemic-induced burnout has had some potentially permanent effects on me.  My ability to focus is better than it was in July of 2021, just after I'd quit, and just when the horrendous three month malaise was setting in, but I'm still finding it really hard to sit down and focus on something without a serious spark of motivation, or the help of drugs to induce it.  My patience is also severely diminished.  I believe I'm still recovering, and I have hope that I will come closer to how I used to be, but I think that acknowledging it is at least a step in the right direction.  I'm still working as hard as I can, both on personal work, and on being the best professional I can be, but it's tough.  I hope you'll root for me, just like I'm rooting for all of you.

        <p><strong>2022-07-24</strong>: Been a while!  I got a job, at Sigma Computing, working on a compiler written in Rust.  Not where I thought I'd end up, but overall I'm thrilled, compilers have always been a blind spot for me, and I've been wanting to learn Rust.  Not finance, but there's always next time.  I got <a href="https://github.com/caracalla/severin">severin</a> into a good state, and I'm hoping to dig more into physics simulation, since that was always the area I wanted to explore the most.</p>

        <p>Outside of coding, my life feels like it barely has a pulse.  I have no friends in my local area, and I'm terrible at keeping up with the ones I already have.  Drawing has been on life support for a while.  I'd like to get involved in the NYC tech scene (there must be one, right?), but so far I've been struggling to find any resources.</p>

        <strong>2022-03-08</strong>: The thought of implementing collision handling in <strong>buffdog</strong> struck fear in my heart for a long time, but I finally <a href="https://twitter.com/caracallarex/status/1499868386624475147">did the damn thing</a> (in a very rudimentary manner), with the help of Christer Ericson's book <a href="https://realtimecollisiondetection.net/">Real-Time Collision Detection</a>.  Further tinkering revealed that rendering more than ~10 platonic solids at once with my software renderer really puts a strain on buffdog's software renderer, so it's finally time to unite my game engine tinkering with my Vulkan learnings and produce an actual game engine.  Working title: <strong>severin</strong>.

        <strong>2022-01-22</strong>: I thought 2022 was gonna be my year, but so far it's been a series of mental gut punches instead.  Nonetheless, I have started the job search (hi to anybody who happens to be checking out my site from my resume), I'm interview prepping, and I've started working on a new (very) simple <a href="game_ideas.html">game idea</a> for <strong>buffdog</strong>/rockshot, Rocket Fighters.  I'll be going to Hawaii and elsewhere for the next couple of weeks, so maybe the distraction will allow me a mental reset.

        <strong>2021-12-12</strong>: Really deep diving on vkguide, vkQuake, and Vulkan-Samples.  I'm still fairly lost in the woods, but I'm beginning to understand how everything within Vulkan interacts, and how the same task can be achieved in many different ways.

        <strong>2021-12-04</strong>: Gave up on Voronoi shattering, I'll come back to it later.  I've decided I need to focus on getting a functional engine working ASAP, and the first order of business is replacing <strong>buffdog</strong>'s software renderer with a bona fide Vulkan render.  To help bridge the gap, I'm following vblanco's <a href="https://vkguide.dev/">Vulkan Guide</a>, which seems to provide a roadmap to building a renderer that behaves similarly to one that would be used in a game engine.  Once I get something basic working there, I'll be moving on to physics and collision detection.  On the drawing front, I've been working pretty hard on hands, and I'm finally seeing some good progress.

        <strong>2021-11-10</strong>: Been drawing about three pages a day, my best output so far.  I've put some more love into <strong>buffdog</strong>, and I'm even considering diving back into Vulkan.  Not sure how I feel about seeking employment again though.

        <strong>2021-10-29</strong>: Drew lots of skulls this month, and I could see the improvement in both that and drawing circles freehand.  However, I'm pretty disappointed with my progress overall, and I'm planning to put much more effort forth in November.

        <strong>2021-09-21</strong>: Adding BSP parsing to <strong>buffdog</strong> as a proof of concept, with the intent to add it to <strong>phalanx</strong> as a pre-built world/level and collision handling system.  I've also been making some Quake maps in <a href="https://trenchbroom.github.io/"">Trenchbroom</a>, both to test the parser and just because it's fun.  Wish I'd gotten into casual level design when I was much younger.

        <strong>2021-09-14</strong>: Trying a new thing where I draw at least five things a day: an ATACMS rocket, a kei truck, a Tom Fox mannequin, a Loomis head, and some perspective boxes.  So far it's prevented me from drawing one line and calling it a day.

        <strong>2021-09-07</strong>: Found the <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples">Vulkan-Samples</a> repository, which seems to contain the solution(s) to my aforementioned problem(s).  </a>Started <a href="https://github.com/caracalla/cmaketest">learning CMake</a> as well, since this and other repositories make heavy use of it.

        <strong>2021-08-30</strong>: Turns out learning Vulkan is hard; there's so many ways to do any particular thing.  Currently struggling with how to propagate model transformation matrices to vertex shaders for each model.

      <li class="casual-update">
        <strong>2021-08-24</strong>: I've made pretty good progress on the Vulkan tutorial, as captured in <strong>phalanx</strong>.  I'm hoping to dive into <a href="https://github.com/Novum/vkQuake">vkQuake</a> and <a href="https://github.com/whatever">vkDOOM3</a> to better understand how Vulkan is actually used to do real time rendering in 3D game engines, since the tutorial really only renders static content, and doesn't deal with continually updated vertices and camera position.  My <strong>buffdog</strong> project handles this, but it's also a very hacky software renderer, and I'm planning to supplement it with a Vulkan renderer once my work with phalanx has run its course.

        <strong>2021-08-23</strong>: I'm hoping to post casual updates here on a regular basis from now on.  Right now, I don't really have an audience to talk about my work with, Twitter feels too restrictive, and writing a full blog post is too high of a bar.

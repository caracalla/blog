# Voronoi Shattering Implementation II - Delaunay Triangulation

What follows is my disorganized notes.  What I hope to eventually present here is a concise explanation of my chosen implementation of 2D Delaunay triangulation, as well as an interactive example built in JS using canvas.

## Facts
* A triangulation does not exist for three or more points if they are colinear
* The circumcircle of a triangle is the unique circle passing through the three vertices of the triangle
* A delaunay triangulation is when the circumcircle of every triangle is empty (no points are in its interior)
* If four or more points lie on the same circle, any triangulation of them is valid

## Algorithm
1. Make big enough triangle
    1. "big enough" means:
        * it contains all points in P
        * will not destroy edges between points in P
            * to deal with this, modify illegal edge test instead
    2. find max and min x and y of P
    3. find midpoint x and y
    4. find max distance M from a max/min to a mid
    5. put verticces at (3M, 0), (0, 3M), (-3M, -3M)
2. insert a point p from P
3. find the triangle t that p lies in
    1. create a DAG D
        1. root of D is big triangle
        2. leaves of D are current triangles
        3. maintain cross pointers between leaves of D and the triangulation (?)
        4. when a triangle is split, the new triangles are the leaves of the current triangle
            * all internal nodes are "destroyed" triangles
            * all leaves are the current triangulation
        5. when doing an edge flip, create new leaves for the new triangles, and add them as leaves of the replaced triangles
    2. starting at root node, find triangle that p lies in for each child until a leaf node is reached
4. divide t into smaller triangles with p as a vertex
    * two possible cases:
        1. p is inside of t - three triangles created from t
        2. p is on an edge of t - two triangles created both triangles that share the edge
            * to make it simpler, just move this one a little bit away from the edge
            * or, just discard it?
            * if a point is < epsilon away from an edge, discard it
    1. update D
5. flip edges until all are legal
    1. first, flip outer edges of original triangle
        * any new edges incident to p are legal
    2. recursively flip edges of new triangles created by flipping edges
    3. LEGALIZEEDGE
6. repeat 2-5 for all other points in P

```
LEGALIZEEDGE(p, pipj, T?)
    if edge is illegal:
        replace pipj with prpl
        LEGALIZEEDGE(p, pipl, T)
        LEGALIZEEDGE(p, pjpl, T)
```

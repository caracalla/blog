# Game Ideas

## Rocket Fighters

The goal here is to make the minimum viable game with what I've built in [buffdog](https://github.com/caracalla/buffdog).  Collision detection is scary, but it's pretty necessary to make any kind of game, so I'll be incorporating it as simply as possible.

The game will have three basic entity types:
* **Platforms** - axis-aligned hexahedrons (I love that word) that will serve as places to stand and/or take cover behind.
* **Fighters** - the player, any enemies, and potentially other players are fighters, represented by cylinders, which will move around on platforms and shoot rockets at each other from shoulder-mounted weapons.
* **Rockets** - Fired by the players, they fly in straight lines at fixed speeds and explode if they hit a fighter, a platform, or fly some fixed distance without hitting anything.  These are already present in buffdog as tetrahedrons.

Thus, the collisions expected will be of the following types:
* fighter-fighter (cylinder-cylinder)
* fighter-platform (cylinder-AABB)
* rocket-platform (ray-AABB)
* rocket-fighter (ray-cylinder)

The level format will specify a list of platforms, followed by player start positions.  I don't think there will be textures or more advanced models, but I could certainly make the players, their weapons, and the rockets more detailed later on without changing the collision types.

## Unspecified Idea

I've been working on another Vulkan engine, which has turned into a kind of hybrid between phalanx and buffdog.  In the long term, I plan on replacing buffdog with it, but for now it's just a scratchpad.  I've implemented a level loading system, which basically consists of:
___
```
# player info (position, rotation)
0.0 0.0 0.0

# assets base directory
assets/

# entities: model, then list of entities using that model
# model format: model_file_name (texture_file_name)
m large_buildingE.obj
# entity format: position.xyz rotation.xyz scale
e 0.0 0.0 -10.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 10.0
e 2.0 0.0 -10.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
e 4.0 0.0 -10.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
e 6.0 0.0 -10.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
e 8.0 0.0 -10.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
m some_other_model.obj
e 8.0 0.0 -10.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
```
___
In this way, the world is populated with entities represented by models, the player is positioned, and I don't have to recompile the code every time I move something.  However, I don't have much beyond that, such as what the world itself will look like (a flat plane? rolling hills? enclosed space?).
